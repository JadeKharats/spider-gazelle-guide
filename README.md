## Off-line Access

After visiting the [Spider-Gazelle Developer Guide](https://spider-gazelle.github.io) with a modern browser, it will continue to load off-line. Magic.

You can also find the plain text content in [docs/](docs/) if you'd prefer for readability, screen readers or printing on your favourite dot-matrix printer like a true modern hipster.


## Contributing
