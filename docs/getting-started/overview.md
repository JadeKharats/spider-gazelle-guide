> An elegant web framework designed to be simple, powerful and fast.

Spider-Gazelle is one of the fastest web frameworks. Without compromising developer productivity / happiness.

This is achieved by making heavy use of [Macros](https://crystal-lang.org/docs/syntax_and_semantics/macros.html) to preprocess and inline as much as possible before compile time.

If you have used [Rails](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/) before you'll instantly feel at home and you'll be happy to know that Spider-Gazelle is up to [32 times faster](https://github.com/the-benchmarker/web-frameworks) than Rails.

It's also very simple to deploy and distribute
